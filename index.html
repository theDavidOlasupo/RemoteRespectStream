                                        <p>
Herb passed away after a short illness at the age of 88. Predeceased by his beloved wife and best friend of 60 years, Helen (née Buckner), proud father of Colin (Colleen), Malcolm (Dianne) and Neil (Kimberley), even prouder Grandpa of Taylor, Kendall, Callum, Paige and Jemima, and much loved by 12 grand dogs over the years.   Herb was born in Monkton, Scotland near the end of the runway at Prestwick Airport, leading  to an early and lifelong interest in airplanes. At the age of six, he could recognize all the British and German planes at the outbreak of World War II. He was a proud graduate of Allan Glen’s  School – a centre for STEM education long before that term became common – where he was  an outstanding pupil and cricketer. He continued his studies at Glasgow University earning a  BSc. in Mechanical Engineering with First Class Honours in 1955.   Immediately after graduation, Herb emigrated to Canada to join Orenda Engines in Toronto to  work on the Iroquois engine for the Avro Arrow. On 20 February 1959 – a Black Friday – he was  one of 14,000 fired over the PA system when the Arrow program was cancelled. He was the  first young engineer called back by Orenda and spent another five years there working on  CANDU reactor projects and the birth of the Orenda industrial gas turbine programs.   In 1964, he accepted a faculty position at the University of Bristol where he worked as a  research consultant to Rolls Royce and the British Aircraft Corporation on the development of  the Concorde power plant. He obtained his PhD in 1968 and his research, started on the  Iroquois, resulted in a major improvement to the Concorde engine.  Herb was invited to join Carleton University in 1970 and returned to Canada with his young  family, remaining in Ottawa for the rest of his life. He spent 28 years as a professor at Carleton,  including 10 years as Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. During his career he  maintained strong research contacts with industry on both sides of the Atlantic, however his  true love was teaching. He was especially proud of a student assessment which commented,  “Tells great jokes!” He would often say he failed Retirement 101, as he continued teaching as a  sessional lecturer for 20 plus years, only re-retiring because of his wife’s failing health. By this  time, he had completed 50 years of teaching at Carleton. He was proud to have introduced the  Industrial Experience Program in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in   1988, which eventually led to the co-op program across the university.  He was very active in the engineering profession, particularly with the Canadian Aeronautics  and Space Institute and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. He was President of  CASI in 1979 and won the major gas turbine award of the ASME in 2004. In 1974, he was  Founding Chairman of the NRC Committee on Industrial Gas Turbines, still going strong in its  third incarnation. He was a Founding Director of GasTOPS Ltd. in 1980 and maintained a close  association until his retirement. In 1980, he spent a sabbatical year with the Royal Navy in  Plymouth with the honorary rank of Captain, R.N.  Herb is probably best known for his authorship of Gas Turbine Theory, having first come across  it as a student in 1954. After completing his PhD, he joined the original authors in producing a  Second Edition with major improvements resulting from his research. He went on to produce  further improvements culminating in the Seventh Edition and translation into five languages.  Gas Turbine Theory has been in continuous print since 1951, a remarkable record for a  technical book.  In 2003, Herb started collaborating with Cranfield University in the U.K., first as an external  examiner, and after four years as a lecturer on their industrial courses. This collaboration  continued until the end of his days and was a source of great satisfaction.  He was a Fellow of CASI, ASME, IMechE and the Canadian Academy of Engineering. Awards  included the Guggenheim Memorial Lecture (2002), the McCurdy Award (CASI, 2005), R. Tom  Sawyer Award (ASME, 2004), International Collaboration Award (ISABE, 2008) and most  recently the 2019 Award of the International Society for Airbreathing Engines for “His  Outstanding Contributions to Airbreathing Engine Technology”.  Herb and Helen were avid travellers and made it a priority to show their boys the world. There  were many family trips to exotic locations, as well as memorable sabbaticals overseas. Later,  Herb and Helen enjoyed finely planned yearly adventures with the grandchildren, exploring  much of Canada, while nurturing an interest in the wider world. In later life, Helen and Herb  enjoyed hiking in Scotland and New Zealand. At 70, Herb was one of the oldest to walk the  Milford Track in New Zealand. They were also proud to walk the West Highland Way –  unaccompanied – when Herb was 72, covering 100 miles through the Highlands from Glasgow  to Fort William; the map of Scotland shows this is uphill all the way.   In the summer of 2021, Herb was nominated for an Order of Canada. Blessed with robust good  health and a sharp mind, it was assumed he would be around for another decade or more. It  was disappointing that a sudden decline in his health meant a formal decision on the award did  not come in time. Referees, colleagues, students and friends agreed he was indeed a great  Canadian.  Also in 2021, a further donation to establish the H.I.H. Saravanamuttoo Catalyst Fund at  Carleton University resulted in a decision to name the Saravanamuttoo Family Atrium in the  new engineering building, currently in the final stages of construction. This, combined with the  H.I.H. Saravanamuttoo Gas Turbine Laboratory and the Professor H.I.H. Saravanamuttoo  Scholarship in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, will cement Herb’s legacy at Carleton.  A joint celebration of life for Herb and Helen will be held in Ottawa at the National Arts Centre  (Canada Room) on Monday, November 1 from 1:00-4:00 pm. The celebration will also be  live-streamed. Details are available at https://saravanamuttoo.remoterespects.ca  Due to  Covid-19 guidelines on gatherings, any person wishing to attend the service must contact the  funeral home to confirm available space and present proof of 2x Vax at the NAC. Arrangements  entrusted to The Whelan Funeral Home, tel. 613-233-1488 or info@WhelanFuneralHome.ca.   In lieu of flowers, donations to the Professor H.I.H. Saravanamuttoo Scholarship would be  welcomed.
